![Component Builder Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joomengine/Joomla-Component-Builder/refs/heads/5.x/admin/assets/images/jcb-banner.jpg "Component Builder")

This is a professional-grade [Joomla 5.x](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/component-builder/) component, created with [Joomla Component Builder (JCB)](https://www.joomlacomponentbuilder.com)—a uniquely advanced development engine for building and maintaining complete Joomla extensions.

> 🎥 [Original... Quick Hello World Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQfsLYIeblk&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&index=45), yes JCB has been around for over a decade.

JCB generates native Joomla components, plugins, and modules for Joomla 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x - and is already prepared for Joomla 6. Every compiled project is tailored for the specific version without needing backward compatibility plugins. With integrated version-aware compiling, smart boilerplating, and Git-powered project syncing, JCB is much more than a code generator-it's a **full-stack development pipeline for Joomla extensions**.

You can install this component easily. The latest release (**5.1.4**) is available on [Releases](https://git.vdm.dev/joomla/pkg-component-builder/releases) and updated frequently with full source access.

Upgrades are seamless through Joomla's built-in extension update mechanism.
