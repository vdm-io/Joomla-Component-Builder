Since JCB has [become a community](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/blob/staging/.github/SUPPORT.md) project [VDM.io](https://www.vdm.io/joomla-component-builder) is **no longer solely responsible** for support.

We have started a [**JCB forum**](https://groups.google.com/a/vdm.io/d/forum/jcb) where you can post questions, about how things work, or if you need some kind of help in relation to your development of your components.

^^ Then if you run into any issues, related to the JCB code, like bugs, **start by searching** the (*open & closed*) issues over on Github, and if the issue has not been mentioned before, **then only** open a new issue, following the [community guidelines](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

WHY GIVE IT AWAY LIKE THIS?
====================

> We are Open Source Enthusiast
> Who Support the Joomla Community

Our idea was to almost let this tool serve as a cheat sheet to how things can be done... and with the help of other developers end up formulating the way how things not only can, but must be done to insure secure, stable, scalable and maintainable code is produced. 

MAKING IT BETTER!
====================

Component Builder is mapped as a component in itself on my local development environment. So we are improving it like you would any other component in it. I am looking for developers with the **skill** and the **desire** to really join us... and then we will [possible give them access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLOfx9YA7VQ&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wsfz3NdKawCiYsALuZ-GhwJ) to this, so we can all help improve this simple, yet advanced tool.
