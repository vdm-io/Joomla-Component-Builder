# WHY GIVE IT AWAY LIKE THIS?

> I am an Open Source Enthusiast
> Who Support the Joomla Community

My idea was to almost let this tool serve as a cheat sheet to how things can be done... and with the help of other developers (more advanced then me) end up formulating the way how things not only can, but must be done to insure secure, stable, scalable and maintainable code is produced. 

# MAKING IT BETTER!

Component Builder is mapped as a component in itself on my local development environment. So I am improving it like you would any other component in it. I am looking for developers with the **skill** and the **desire** to really join me... and then I will possible give them access to this, so we can all help improve this simple, yet advanced tool.
