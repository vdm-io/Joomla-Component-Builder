WHY GIVE IT AWAY LIKE THIS?
====================

> We are Open Source Enthusiast
> Who Support the [Joomla](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/component-builder/) Community

Our idea was to almost let this tool serve as a cheat sheet to how things can be done... and with the help of other developers end up formulating the way how things not only can, but must be done to insure secure, stable, scalable and maintainable code is produced. 

MAKING IT BETTER!
====================

Get involved on the forums, and the Gitea issues, and you can even help us develop/improve the pipeline of [JCB](https://www.joomlacomponentbuilder.com) for continues delivery. We really want to see [JCB](https://www.joomlacomponentbuilder.com) remain the tool of choice for all [Joomla Component Development](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/component-builder/) needs and ideas.

TODO
======

- Add automatic unit testing. To nurture pipeline integration for all components build with [JCB](https://www.joomlacomponentbuilder.com).
- Team collaborative development across [JCB](https://www.joomlacomponentbuilder.com) installations offline and online.
- Documentation (maintained by the community) for [JCB](https://www.joomlacomponentbuilder.com). (help us select the best system for this)
