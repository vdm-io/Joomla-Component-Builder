Since [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com) has [become a community](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/blob/staging/.github/SUPPORT.md) project [VDM.io](https://www.vdm.io/) is **no longer solely responsible** for support.

We have started a [**JCB forum**](https://vdm.bz/jcb-forum) where you can post questions, about how things work, or if you need some kind of help in relation to your development of your components.

^^ Then if you run into any issues, related to the [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com) code, like bugs, **start by searching** the (*open & closed*) issues over on Github, and if the issue has not been mentioned before, **then only** open a new issue, following the [community guidelines](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

WHY GIVE IT AWAY LIKE THIS?
====================

> We are Open Source Enthusiast
> Who Support the [Joomla](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/component-builder/) Community

Our idea was to almost let this tool serve as a cheat sheet to how things can be done... and with the help of other developers end up formulating the way how things not only can, but must be done to insure secure, stable, scalable and maintainable code is produced. 

MAKING IT BETTER!
====================

Get involved on the forums, and the GitHub issues, and you can even help us develop/improve the pipeline of [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com) for continues delivery. We really want to see [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com) remain the tool of choice for all [Joomla Component Development](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/component-builder/) needs and ideas.

TODO
======

- Add automatic (REST) API ability for all components build with [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com). So we can link any component build with JCB to an Android/Apple APP.
- Add automatic unit testing. To nurture pipeline integration for all components build with [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com).
- Team collaborative development across [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com) installations offline and online.
- Documentation (maintained by the community) for [JCB](http://joomlacomponentbuilder.com). (help us select the best system for this)
